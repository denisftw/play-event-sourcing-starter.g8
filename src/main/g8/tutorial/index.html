  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  Since this template is based on Activator, I assume that you already have JDK8 installed.
  In addition, you will also need to have PostgreSQL 9.5 installed to run the app. If you're using an up-to-date version of Ubuntu, this is easy to do:

  <pre><code>
  $ sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 postgresql-contrib-9.5 pgadmin3
  </code></pre>

  Make sure that the PostgreSQL server is up and running and create a new user:

  <pre><code>
  $ /usr/bin/sudo -u postgres psql --command "CREATE USER scalauser WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'scalapass';"
  </code></pre>

  Then, create a new database for our authentication mechanism:

  <pre><code>
  $ /usr/bin/sudo -u postgres createdb -O scalauser authdb
  </code></pre>

  The application also utilizes a frontend workflow based on NodeJS. This means that you'll need to have two NodeJS tools installed - <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code>. Since NodeJS is in constant development, I recommend you install nvm - the NodeJS version manager. Just go to <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script">their website</a> and follow the instructions. Again, if you're on Ubuntu (or other Unix), everything is easy:

  <pre><code>
  $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh | bash
  </code></pre>

  After <code>nvm</code> is installed, use it to obtain NodeJS itself:

  <pre><code>
  $ nvm install v5.3.0
  </code></pre>

  Add this to the very end of your .bashrc to make sure that NodeJS 5.3.0 is used by default:

  <pre><code>
  nvm use v5.3.0 > /dev/null
  </code></pre>

  Open a new terminal and check that <code>npm</code> is available:

  <pre><code>
  $ npm --version
  3.3.12
  </code></pre>

  Finally, go to the project directory and download frontend dependencies by typing the following:

  <pre><code>
  $ npm install
  </code></pre>

  <code>npm</code> will download necessary packages to <code>node_modules</code> (not under version control). It may take some time, but once it is done, you can finally start compilation of frontend assets by invoking the following script:

  <pre><code>
  $ npm run watch
  </code></pre>

  Finally, use another terminal window to start Activator in debug mode:

  <pre><code>
  $ ./activator -jvm-debug 9999
  </code></pre>

  Note that Webpack is started in the monitor mode and recompile frontend assets after you change them. Once you start the Play application from Activator using the <code>run</code> command, it will also start monitoring backend source files for changes.
